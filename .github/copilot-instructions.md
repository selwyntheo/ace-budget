## Project Overview
This is a React TypeScript budget management application built with Vite. The application helps users create new funds based on model funds with three main workflows:

1. **Fund Selection Page**: Users can view and select model funds from a list
2. **Budget Projection Page**: Users input budget parameters based on selected model funds
3. **Review Output Page**: Users review the final budget projections and outputs

## Technical Stack
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Routing**: React Router DOM
- **Styling**: CSS Modules or styled-components preferred
- **State Management**: React Context API or useState/useEffect patterns

## Code Style Guidelines
- Use functional components with hooks
- Implement TypeScript interfaces for all data structures
- Use proper error handling and loading states
- Follow React best practices for component composition
- Implement responsive design patterns
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Add proper accessibility attributes

## Key Features to Maintain
- Fund selection with model fund comparison
- Interactive budget projection forms
- Real-time calculation updates
- Data persistence between pages
- User-friendly navigation
- Professional, modern UI design
